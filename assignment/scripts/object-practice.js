  - Give it a boolean 'hasSiblings' property
  - Give it  a numeric 'shoeCount' property
  - Also give it an array 'favThreeFoods'

  - Create a variable called fullName
  - Use the firstName & lastName properties of the object you
    created above to set its value.
  - Console.log fullName

  - Console.log your first favorite food
  - Console.log your last favorite food

  - Cool huh? It works, even though it wasn't there before
  - Console.log your object
